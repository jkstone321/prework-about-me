      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am 24 years old and I used to work as a delivery driver and assistant general manager at Hot Box Pizza in Carmel, Indiana, just north of Indianapolis. I have a cat named Leah and my mom has a cat named Jasmine (Jazz for short.) They get along pretty well but sometimes they give each other a push into the pool.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Greenwood, Indiana, which is just south of Indianapolis. Then I moved to Carmel.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing a variety of different video games like Risk of Rain 2, Path of Exile, Runescape (Old School and RS3), Final Fantasy XIV, and occasionally Maplestory for the nostalgia. I also enjoy riding my bike around my neighborhood and going on walks on the beach with my mom and dad.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't necessarily have a "Dream Job," I would just want to enjoy the work that I am doing.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live about 30 minutes north of Tampa, in Land o Lakes.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love working with computers and I've always been interested in the inner workings of websites, programs and applications that I use everyday.</p>
